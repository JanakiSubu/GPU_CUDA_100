- Understood the importance of bounds checking when the total thread count may exceed the problem size.
- Saw how a single __global__ kernel can parallelize all row‑wise dot‑products, leveraging unified memory to simplify data management.

## Day 04 — partialsum.cu
**Project File**: `partialsum.cu`

**What I Did**
- Summed two elements per thread into shared memory with guarded, coalesced loads.
- Implemented a tree-based inclusive `scan (O(log blockSize))` using synchronized strides.
- Computed `gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize - 1)/(2*blockSize)` to cover all inputs.
- Added a `CUDA_CHECK` macro to validate every CUDA API call.

Key Takeaways

---

## Day 06 — MatrixTranspose.cu

**Project File:** `MatrixTranspose.cu`

**What I Did**  
- Implemented a naïve transpose kernel with bounds checks.  
- Chose TILE_DIM = 32 and BLOCK_ROWS = 8 so each block handles a 32×32 tile in eight thread-rows, balancing shared-memory usage and occupancy.
- Launched the kernel with a 2D grid of blocks sized (width + TILE_DIM - 1) / TILE_DIM × (height + TILE_DIM - 1) / TILE_DIM to cover the entire matrix.

**Key Takeaways**  
- Coalesced Access: Tiling groups global loads and stores into contiguous bursts, significantly improving memory throughput.
- Shared-Memory Reuse: Staging data in on-chip shared memory reduces redundant global reads and writes.
- Bank-Conflict Avoidance: Adding one column of padding prevents threads in the same warp from hitting the same shared-memory bank.

## Day 7 — CUDA Convolution Recipes  
**Project Files:**  
- `one_d_convolution.cu`  
- `one_d_convolution_with_tiling.cu`  
- `2d_convolution_with_tiling.cu`  

### What I Did  
- **one_d_convolution.cu**:  
  - Implemented a naïve 1D convolution kernel that slides a 1×K mask over an input array.  
  - Mapped each thread to compute one output element, using `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`.  
  - Added boundary checks (halo cells) to skip out-of-bounds memory accesses.

- **one_d_convolution_with_tiling.cu**:  
  - Extended the 1D version with shared-memory tiling.  
  - Loaded each tile (plus halo regions) of the input array into shared memory.  
  - Used `__syncthreads()` to synchronize before computing the convolution.

- **Shared-memory tiling**  
  - Mastered loading contiguous blocks (and halos) into on-chip memory to reduce global-memory traffic.  
- **Synchronization & performance trade-offs**

## Day 08 — prefixsum_brent_kung_algorithm.cu

**Project File:** `prefixsum_brent_kung_algorithm.cu`

### What I Did
- Loaded pairs of elements into shared memory and handled out-of-bounds indices with zero-padding.
- Implemented the Brent–Kung scan:
  - **Up-sweep (reduce)**: built a partial‐sum tree in-place.
  - **Down-sweep**: distributed the partial sums back down to produce the final prefix sums.
- Launched a 1D grid where each block processes 64 elements (2 × 32 threads).
- Added rigorous bounds checks on loads and stores to avoid illegal memory accesses.
- Used `__restrict__` and `const` qualifiers to help the compiler optimize global memory traffic.
- Wrapped CUDA calls in an `inline checkCudaError()` helper for clearer error reporting.

### Key Takeaways
- **Hierarchical scan structure**: splitting work into a balanced binary tree (up-sweep) then propagating results (down-sweep) yields work-efficient parallel scans.
- **Shared‐memory orchestration**: careful use of `__syncthreads()` between strides is critical to ensure correctness without excessive divergence.
- **Block‐level vs. full-array scan**: while this version computes an inclusive scan within each block, extending it to arbitrary-length arrays requires a second (“carry‐propagate”) pass across blocks.
- **Performance hygiene**: zero-padding incomplete segments and marking pointers as `__restrict__` prevents hidden data hazards and helps maximize GPU throughput.

## Day 09 — flash_attention_forward.cu

**Project File:** `flash_attention_forward.cu`

---

**What I Did**  
- Implemented a tile-based Flash Attention forward pass in CUDA (toy example: N=2, d=2).  
- Staged Q, K, V in Br×Bc shared-memory tiles, computed per-tile Q·Kᵀ scores.  
- Subtracted each row’s max before `expf()` and recorded both max and sum-of-exps for numerical stability.  
- Accumulated softmax-weighted sums into the output buffer with a single-kernel prototype.  

**Key Takeaways**  
- **Shared-memory tiling:** Reduced global memory traffic by staging Q/K/V blocks on-chip.  
- **Numerical stability:** Learned the importance of row-max subtraction to avoid overflow in `expf()`.  
- **Tile sizing trade-offs:** Observed how Br and Bc (derived from `SRAM_SIZE`) affect occupancy and register usage.  

**What I Read**  
- Tri Dao et al., “FlashAttention: Fast and Memory‐Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness,” NeurIPS 2022  
- NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide — shared memory, occupancy tuning, and kernel optimizations

- ## Day 10 — Sparse_MatrixVecMult_Hybrid.cu

**Project File:** `Sparse_MatrixVecMult_Hybrid.cu`

**What I Did**
- Implemented a hybrid SpMV kernel that packs up to **TH=20** nonzeros per row into ELL (Ellpack), spilling extras into a global COO array via `atomicAdd`.
- Zero-filled unused ELL slots and stored per-row column indices.
- In each thread:
  1. **ELL multiplication:** iterate fixed TH entries per row.  
  2. **COO accumulation:** scan the global COO list, adding matching-row entries.
- Wrapped CUDA calls in a `CUDA_CHECK` macro for robust error handling.

**Key Takeaways**
- **ELL vs. COO trade-offs:** ELL gives regular accesses for up to TH nonzeros; COO handles overflow with minimal padding.
- **Atomic writes:** `atomicAdd` appends COO entries without precomputing row quotas, at the cost of serialized writes.
- **Memory layout:** storing ELL in column‐major “slices” (`[p * N + row]`) yields coalesced loads for `x[col]`.

**What I Read**
- PMPP Chapter 10: Parallel sparse‐matrix techniques—CSR/ELL/COO formats, load balancing, padding for regularized access.

  - **Kernel timing** via CUDA events and PyTorch timing events.  
- Logged **memory usage** (`psutil`) and **estimated sparse footprint** to avoid OOM.

**Key Takeaways**
- **End-to-end benchmarking** must include compile, transfer, and launch overheads.  
- **Memory-safety checks** (e.g. cap nnz to 70% of RAM) prevent large-matrix crashes.  
- **Source injection** simplifies multi-size testing without manual edits.

## Day 11 — merge\_path\_parallel\_merge.cu

**Project File:** `merge_path_parallel_merge.cu`

**What I Did**

* Created a `merge_path_partition()` device function to perform binary search across the diagonal `k = i + j` in the logical 2D merge grid of arrays A and B.
* Launched `N + M` threads where each thread:

  * Computes its diagonal index and determines the co-rank split `(i, j)`.
  * Selects the smaller of `A[i]` or `B[j]` and writes to `C[k]`.
* Used `printf()` inside the kernel to trace: thread ID, diagonal, source array, and output position.
* Verified the final merged array was fully sorted and correct.

**Key Takeaways**

* **Merge Path** provides a work-balanced parallel merge across threads with no synchronization needed.
* Learned how to use **diagonal binary search** to assign merge ranges in parallel.

## Day 12 — tiled_matmul.cu

**Project File:** `tiled_matmul.cu`

### What I Did

- Implemented a **tiled matrix multiplication (GEMM)** kernel on the GPU using shared-memory.  
- Divided each \(N\times N\) matrix into `TILE_SIZE×TILE_SIZE` sub-blocks that each thread-block cooperatively loads into shared memory.
  
- Each thread computes one element of \(C\) by iterating over all tiles:  
  1. Loads a tile of A and a tile of B into `__shared__` arrays (`sA`, `sB`), zero-padding out-of-bounds entries.  
  2. Synchronizes with `__syncthreads()`.  
  3. Performs a `#pragma unroll` inner loop of length `TILE_SIZE` to accumulate the dot-product.  
  4. Synchronizes again before loading the next tile.
     
- Wrapped the kernel launch in **CUDA events** (`cudaEventRecord`/`cudaEventElapsedTime`) to measure in-kernel execution time.  
- Added host-side setup to:  
  - Parse `N` from the command line (default 256 for quick demos).  
  - Allocate and initialize host/device arrays.  
  - Verify correctness by checking `C[0]` and `C[N*N-1]` against the expected sum.


### Key Takeaways

- **Shared-Memory Tiling:** Greatly reduces global-memory traffic by reusing each tile across multiple multiplications.  
- **Work Distribution:** Each thread handles one output element, ensuring balanced compute.  
- **Performance Instrumentation:** CUDA events provide precise kernel timing, decoupled from host overhead.

## Day 13 — cmpFHD.cu & cmpFHD_real_image.cu

**Project Files:**  
- `cmpFHD.cu`  
- `cmpFHD_real_image.cu`  

### What I Did

- **Core FHD kernel** (`cmpFHD.cu`):  
  - Implemented the Fully-Hybrid Domain (FHD) update pass over non-Cartesian k-space samples in CUDA.  
  - Broke the full trajectory (`M = 1024` samples) into `CHUNK_SIZE = 256` tiles and loaded each tile into `__constant__` memory (`kx_c, ky_c, kz_c`).  
  - Each GPU thread:  
    1. Reads its point coordinates `(x[n], y[n], z[n])` and initial complex accumulator `(rPhi, iPhi)`.  
    2. Loops over the tile, computes  
       ```cpp
       angle = 2π * (kx·x + ky·y + kz·z);
       realAcc += rMu[m]*cosf(angle) − iMu[m]*sinf(angle);
       imagAcc += iMu[m]*cosf(angle) + rMu[m]*sinf(angle);
       ```  
    3. Writes back updated `(rPhi, iPhi)` and computes magnitude `phiMag = sqrt(r² + i²)`.  
  - Host orchestration:  
    - Allocates and initializes host arrays (`h_x, h_y, h_z, h_rMu, h_iMu, h_rPhi, h_iPhi`).  
    - Copies data to device buffers and, per chunk, uploads trajectory tile via `cudaMemcpyToSymbol`.  
    - Launches `cmpFHD<<<blocks, 256>>>(…)` and synchronizes.  
    - Copies results back and prints a few sample values for validation.

- **Real-image extension** (`cmpFHD_real_image.cu`):  
  - Integrated OpenCV to load a grayscale image (`lena_gray.png` → `CV_32F [0,1]`).  
  - Mapped pixel `(i, j)` → normalized `(x, y)` and intensity → `z`.  
  - Ran the identical chunked FHD kernel on this point cloud.  
  - Converted the per-pixel magnitude back to an 8-bit image and saved `output.jpg`.

###  Key Takeaways

1. **Constant-Memory Tiling**  Broadcasting a small tile of k-space samples to all threads dramatically cuts global-memory pressure.  
2. **Per-Thread Work Balance**  One thread per output point simplifies divergence and ensures each thread does equal work.  
3. **Hybrid Memory Management**  Managed vs. explicit `cudaMalloc`/`cudaMemcpy` approaches: tradeoff between simplicity and control.  
4. **Real-World Pipeline**  Integrating OpenCV with CUDA, handling I/O, pre/post-processing around the core compute kernel.
